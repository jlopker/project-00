Technical Requirements:
  - You met all the technical requirements!
  - Good frequent commits with details messages

Creativity:
  - I really like the font racing concept

Code Quality:
  - Your code is very DRY and well commented, nice work! I also appreciate your thorough README.
  - Your indentation in `app.js` could use a little work.
  - I would've liked to see more functions defined outside of `$(document).on('ready')` and called within it.
  - More Bootstrap integration! You have buttons that could easily be styled with Bootstrap.
